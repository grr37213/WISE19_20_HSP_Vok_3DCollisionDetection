abstract = {"Let G be a finite simple graph. Let S⊆V(G), its closed interval I[S] is the set of all vertices lying on shortest paths between any pair of vertices of S. The set S is convex if I[S]=S. In this work we define the concept of a convex partition of graphs. If there exists a partition of V(G) into p convex sets we say that G is p-convex. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a graph G is p-convex for a fixed integer p≥2. We show that every connected chordal graph is p-convex, for 1≤p≤n. We also establish conditions on n and k to decide if the k-th power of a cycle Cn is p-convex. Finally, we develop a linear-time algorithm to decide if a cograph is p-convex."}
